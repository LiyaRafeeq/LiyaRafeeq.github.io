2. Homepage

Overview -
The homepage serves as the first point of contact, introducing visitors to my brand and work.  

Key Elements -
Here, I have 4 "LIYA"s, basically four different sections of my life and interests.

3. "Interactive Media" Page

Purpose -
Showcase my professional and creative projects, mostly done inside the Interactive Media courses at NYUAD. 

Layout -
Initially it was just going to be boxes of information and a link to each website, but I decided I wanted to do something fun.
Vogue has always been one of my dream companies that I admire, so I decided to use their "Whats in my Bag" videos as inspiration
Here I'll add in more projects as more things "in my bag".

4. "Photography" Page

Purpose -
Highlight my work as an amateur photographer across various themes. Some of these photographs were taken for other courses, some are just taken 
for fun!

Layout -
A Gallery View, featuring categories of photographies, with their title and description.

Note: In my initial wireframe, the page wasn't interactive and the images were just displayed in grid view. However, I felt that was too plain
and that the aesthetics wouldn't match. Hence, I switched to this gallery view. 

5. "Content Creation" Page

Purpose -
Demonstrate my skills in producing engaging content for digital platforms.  

6. "Wait Who Am I Really" Page

Purpose -
Give visitors a sense of who I am, both professionally and personally. This page is more for an informal "get to know me". 

7. Profile Page

Purpose -
Provide a detailed view of my career and skills for professional opportunities.  This will serve as my profession and formal
resume for potential employers.
