        lee.arch1ve is a safe space I created online, on Instagram. If I were to summarise it,
        I'd say it's a world of aesthetics, where vintage meets preppy meets dark academia. 
        It's a place for me to share my journalling, some poetry and some very aesthetic baking.
        Content creation was never really a "dream" of mine, and this account isn't really me being
        an "influencer", it's just a space for me to share my love for aesthetics with like minded
        people, and build a community online.
