THE MEMORY GARDEN

The Memory Garden strives to create a safe space for everyone, particularly young adults, who need a break from the stress of everyday life. Through its vintage feel and calming vibe, the film aims to 
empathise with the audience on how important it is to recharge and rejuvenate our mind, body and soul. Whether its taking a nap, reading a book, journalling your thoughts, whatever be the mthod, we need to take 
a break sommetimes.

Home Page 

This home page has a navigation bar- with buttons to all the pages in the website, (The Film, About the People. Inspo + Moodboards, Behind the Scenes)
The image carousel also serves as a tool to navigate to tose pages, specifically in the home screen. Plus, it served as a visual aesthetic and a tool for interactivity. After that, we have a brief introduction and concept map. It's followed by a review carousel. 

Note: Original wireframe has an email responses section. However, I felt that the contact page was sufficient enough for any doubts and inquiries. So, that was scarpped out of the final project.

The Film

Simple layout, image and a direction holder, which on click will direct us to the film. The film should embody feelings of positivty and calmness. 

Behind the Scenes

The behind the scenes images are pretty straightforward. We have the setting of the shoot, and detailed texts on our thought process. 

Inspo + Moodboards

This was made using a template for photo collage. It has a few texts to describe the aesthetic we followed, and some pictures to show the inspirations and moodboard.

About the People

This has two image profile holders, on click we reach their personal profiles and contact details. 
Note: Initial wireframe featured profile and a button with contact details, but I wanted both the profiles to come in a single frame rather than to scroll down for it, so I used this format instead. 

Overall, I want this website to be simple to follow, to radiate calmness and collective memories, and to truly embody what the memory garden wants- a safe space for everyone to relax and recharge.
