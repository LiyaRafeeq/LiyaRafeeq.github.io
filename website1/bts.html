    <h2> The Place</h2>
            <p>Walking to class I saw this place right next door... didm't think much of it then. <br>
                Until, surprise! Our professor told us to make a film in 30 minutes!! <br>
            We chose this place in the Arts Center at NYUAD. It was in Level 1 beside the stairs...<br>
            the perfect place for our memory garden shoot.</p>

    <h2> The Shoot </h2>
            <p>The setting was serene, we decided to build the story from there. Youth tired from the<br>
                 constant stress and build up of life- needing a chance to escape from<br>
                the sounds of the world...what better place than a lush green garden with seatings and<br>
                 a small cozy library. Principle shots were taken by me, and Ziya took the role of acting!</p>

    <h2> The Props</h2>
            <p>I had my morning coffee with me, so we decided to use that asa prop. The shelves had a <br>
                collection of books, we chose one for the initial shots. We still had to bring in <br>
                a personal element, some intimate, something that would speak to the audience<br>
                then Ziya's quick thinking saved us!! She ran to her dorm and got her scrapbook, final touches<br>
                to the props!

    <h2> The Film </h2>
            <p>The shooting was done...we edited the video in Capcut, ddded in some filters to give it <br>
                that vintage camera aesthetic. Then 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...SHOW TIME!</p>
