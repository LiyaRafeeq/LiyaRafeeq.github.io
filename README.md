Home Page 

This home page has a navigation bar- with buttons to all the pages in the website, (The Film, About the People. Inspo + Moodboards, Behind the Scenes)
The image carousel also serves as a tool to navigate to tose pages, specifically in the home screen. Plus, it served as a visual aesthetic and a tool for interactivity. After that, we have a brief introduction and concept map. It's followed by a review carousel. After that, we have an email responses section.

The Film

Simple layout, image and a direction holder, which on click will direct us to the film. 

Behind the Scenes

Inspo + Moodboards

This was made using a template for photo collage. It has a few texts to describe the aesthetic we followed, and some pictures to show the inspirations and moodboard.
About the People

This has two image profile holders, on click we reach their personal profiles and contact details. 
Note: Initial wireframe featured profile and a button with contact details, but I wanted both the profiles to come in a single frame rather than to scroll down for it, so I used this format instead.
