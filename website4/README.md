Project Name: 

The Project Name is “Vault of Secrets: Legendary Heists."

Project Description

For this sound project, we decided to create a podcast that explores history’s most daring and legendary heists. The concept and theme of this podcast revolve around uncovering thrilling tales of real-life crimes. We focused on the Banco Central Heist in Fortaleza, Brazil—a heist that reads like a movie script due to its meticulous planning and dramatic execution.  By providing engaging storytelling, sound effects, and conversational commentary, the experience aims to immerse listeners, allowing them to feel like they are part of the unfolding drama. The goal is to create a suspenseful, cinematic experience that keeps listeners hooked, evoking both fascination and curiosity about the audacity of these legendary heists.

Process:

First of all, we started with brainstorming to gather ideas and align on a shared vision. While brainstorming Asma came up with the idea of creating a podcast inspired by Rotten Mango by Stephanie Soo, a podcast that delves deep into the darkest crimes in detail.  Inspired by this podcast, we came up with the ceoncpet of making a podcast on the legendary heists.
Then, we divided the tasks and assigned the tasks among ourselves. We divided the work largely into five parts: scripting for the podcast, recording, editing the record, coding the website, and documentation. Then, we distributed the task among our selves. Asma and Liya wrote the script for the podcast and recorded the podcast together. Asma edited the podcast. Liya and Sihyun coded the website for the podcast. Lastly, Sihyun took charge of documentation. 

Reflection/Evaluation:

During the process of making this project, we encountered some challenges. First of all, we had quite a hard time acquiring the equipment needed to record the audio. Since it was first time for us to navigate through the equipment booking system, we did not know what to do and how to book the equipment needed. However, with the help of the student assistant in the equipment center, we were able to successfully get the sound equipments we needed.

Also, it was first time for Asma to use Audacity to edit the audio. So, she found the app itself very confusing at first. However, as she watched some youtube videos and explored Audacity, she got familiar with it. And she was able to successfully edit the audio.
Coming up for the idea of how the website is supposed to be was indeed one of the hardest challenges for this assignment. As this involved how to make the website visually appealing and how best to integrate features that would support the dark, suspenseful theme of the podcast. Then, Liya came up with the idea of making animations of some related icons dropping as we scrolled through the website. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWflDh-Z5qA This youtube tutorial was very helpful in creating the animation. 

In coding, Liya had a hard time figuring out the “font problem”. After finalizing other parts, she discovered that the font is not being implemented properly. After some attemption to fix the codes, she asked Sihyun to fix this problem. And we were able to successfully fix this problem as this problem occurred because we never called the font itself correctly in the coding. 

Our initial goals were to deliver a podcast that would both engage and transport listeners into the world of legendary heists, and the final output achieved just that. The Banco Central Heist story, paired with sound effects and conversational storytelling, created the dramatic, cinematic experience we’d hoped for. Additionally, the website, enhanced with animations and a dark, sleek design, visually supported the podcast’s theme and added another layer of engagement for the audience. Despite challenges, we managed to address them, and the final product aligned closely with our original vision, meeting our expectations fully. Looking back, we’re proud that the project stayed true to our concept and turned out exactly as we had intended.
